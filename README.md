Dataset C02 Emissions Canada, which can be found in the data directory, was taken from Kaggle ([here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/debajyotipodder/co2-emission-by-vehicles)).

Some insights on this dataset:
| Name | Description |
|---|---|
| Model | 4WD/4X4 = Four-wheel drive<br>AWD = All-wheel drive<br>FFV = Flexible-fuel vehicle<br>SWB = Short wheelbase<br>LWB = Long wheelbase<br>EWB = Extended wheelbase |
| Transmission | A = Automatic<br>AM = Automated manual<br>AS = Automatic with select shift<br>AV = Continuously variable<br>M = Manual<br>3 - 10 = Number of gears |
| Fuel type | X = Regular gasoline<br>Z = Premium gasoline<br>D = Diesel<br>E = Ethanol (E85)<br>N = Natural gasoline |
| FuelConsumptionCity | City fuel consumption ratings (L/100 km) |
| FuelConsumptionHwy | Highway fuel consumption ratings (L/100km) |
| FuelConsumptionComb | Combined rating (55% city, 45% hwy) (L/100km) |
| FuelConsumptionCombMpg | Combined rating (55% city, 45% hwy) (mpg) |
| CO2 emissions | Tailpipe emissions of CO2 (g/km) |
